# 1. PRINT THREE DIFFERENT STRINGS

# print("Hello")
# print("World")
# print("!")

# 2. WRITE A PROGRAM THAT PRINTS A MESSAGE IF A VARIABLE IS LESS THAN 10,
# AND DIFFERENT MESSAGE IF THE VARIABLE IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 10

# variable = 15
# if variable <= 10:
#     print("Variable is less than 10")
# else:
#     print("Variable is greater than or equal to 10")

# 3. WRITE A PROGRAM THAT PRINTS A MESSAGE IF A VARIABLE IS LESS THAN 10,
# ANOTHER MESSAGE IF THE VARIABLE IS GREATER THAN 10 BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 25,
# AND ANOTHER MESSAGE IF THE VARIABLE IS GREATER THAN 25

# variable = 8
# if variable <= 10:
#     print("Variable is less than 10")
# elif variable > 10 and variable <= 25:
#     print("Variable is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 25")
# else:
#     print("Variable is greater than 25")

# 3. CREATE A PROGRAM THAT DIVIDES TWO VARIABLES AND PRINTS THE REMAINDER

# a = 14
# b = 4
# c = a % b
# print(c)

# 5. CREATE A PROGRAM THAT TAKES VARIABLES, DIVIDES THEM AND PRINTS THE QUOTIENT
# a = 13
# b = 8
# c = a // b
# print(c)

# 6. WRITE A PROGRAM WITH  VARIABLE AGE ASSIGNED TO AN INTEGER THAT PRINTS DIFFERENT STRINGS DEPENDING ON WHAT INTEGER AGE IS

age = 29
if age <= 18:
    print("Wow, you're young!")
else:
    print("Wow, you're old!")
